# EvCC Ethical Hacking Club
The EvCC Ethical Hacking Club is a sub-group of the larger EvCC STEM Club, currently advised by Dennis Skarr. Please note that this GitHub organization is very new and subject to change.

## Projects
The goal of this GitHub organization is to maintain projects in a central way that allows for a record of club work to be kept in either active or archived repositories, and to allow new members to view and access project code as necessary.

### Pitching Projects
Projects should be pitched and voted on during club meetings. Members can show interest in pitched projects by collaborating with others to make a new repository within this organization to host the project.

### Project leads
While projects are intended to be open to all members, a project lead should be dedicated to allow for a 'final say' on code commits. This will be ideally voted on during club meetings.

## Conventions
Since we're rather new, there are not many set conventions as of yet. This will surely be developed in the future.

### Languages
There is so far no language requirements for projects - so long as a project can be coherent in using moving parts across platforms. EvCC classes support a variety of programming languages, but mainly fall between C++ and Java. It is common for our members to have a background in programming through simpler languages like Python or HTML.
